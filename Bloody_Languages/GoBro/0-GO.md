_Go is an compiled language ⟢_  
_Development known for it’s simplicity (just like python) for its simple syntax 🙈_  
*GoLang excels in **performance compared to Python, Ruby, etc ,..⏫***

*GoLang is **statically typed*** -> So we can Code Better 😌  
***High performance** ?? Yeahhhhh, we can produce even at reduced costs📈*  
_No need to worry about **garbage collecting** 🗑️_

***Go routines** are like cheap virtual threads which can be multiplexed across real threads.*  
_It is easier to make parts of codebase communicate with help of **go-routines, Channels, mutexes, waitGroups,** etc_ 🔒 🎈

Source Code -> Compiler -> Machine Code [DEVELOPMENT]  
Machine Code -> OS -> Hardware [DEPLOYMENT]
