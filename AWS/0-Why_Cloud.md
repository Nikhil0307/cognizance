>*Before cloud emerged, organizations had their own compute, store and network equipments*
>*At a particular point of time as the need grows , the need of resources and need to maintain grew in a linear pattern -> leading to difficulties to maintain by orgs*

There are three types of deployment in general 
- On-Permisis
- Cloud
- Hybrid

**On-Permisis Deployment**
- Organization maintains their own local compute, store and networking equipements

**Cloud Deployment**
- Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of IT services such as network, compute and storage provided over the internet with primarily *pay-as-you-go pricing*
- Companies such as AWS owns and maintains data centers to provide services to organizations and users over the internet 
- With cloud computing, organizations doesn't need to explicitly maintain their own data centers and hardwares

**Hybrid Deployment**
- Hybrid deployment is the combination of both cloud and on-permisis hardware
