CPU cycles , CPU cycles and CPU cycles everywhere...... whattt are theyyy exactly 😵

In simple CPU cycle is a instruction cycle, representing the basic unit of time in which CPU executes instructions

**What happens in a CPU cycle ???** 🚲
- ***Fetch :*** Retrieve next instruction from memory
- ***Decode :*** Decode the fetched instruction to understand what operation should be done
- ***Execute :***  Executes the decoded instruction
- ***Write-back :***  Storing the result of the executed instruction in the memory

> *A single instruction may take several CPU cycles to complete, depending on the complexity of the instruction and the architecture of the CPU*
> *This CPU cycles for executing a instruction varies with respect to the type of CPU*

**How does CPU's performance is decided with CPU cycle ?** 🌍🌏🌎

*You might be like realllyyy ? does CPU cycle concludes the performance of CPU ???*
Yesss, the performance of the CPU cycle depends on the number of cycles it can execute in a given time, which is governed by clock speed *(eg:: 2.5 GHz -> explaining 2.5 billion cycles per 
second)*
Though, it also depends on ***CPI*** (Cycles Per Instruction), which is nothing but how many cycles does the CPU require to execute a single instruction on average.

> *Wrapping with considering an instance where, a CPU with lower clock speed but fewer cycles per instruction may outperform a higher clock speed CPU with inefficient instruction handling*
